<p> Arya 2 is a 2009 Indian Telugu-language psychological romantic action film co-written and directed by Sukumar. Produced by Aditya Babu and B. V. S. N. Prasad under the Aditya Arts banner, the film stars Allu Arjun in the titular role, alongside Kajal Aggarwal and Navdeep with music composed by Devi Sri Prasad. It serves as a spiritual sequel to Arya (2004).[1]

The film explores the complex love-hate relationship between two childhood friends, Arya and Ajay, and their mutual love for Geetha, set against a backdrop of corporate and family conflicts. Arya 2 was released theatrically on 27 November 2009 to mixed reviews. While the film opened to strong box office collections, its run was affected in Telangana due to disruptions caused by the Telangana agitation.[2] The film was later dubbed into Malayalam with the same title, and released across Kerala on 5 February 2010 with 100 prints and was successful in the state.</p>
